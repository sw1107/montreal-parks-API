# Montreal Parks API

## Description

For this project I have created an API to access and contribute to information about Montreal parks.

Users can make a number of requests including:
* GET - Get all parks
* GET - Search for park by borough
* GET - Search for park by name
* POST - Add park
* PATCH - Update park features
* DELETE - Delete park

Data is held in an SQL database and accessed using SQLAlchemy.

API documentation is created and published using Postman.

## Technologies
